---------------Methods Location
All retrieve methods: Queries
CUD-methods: Commands


---------------Methods Logic rules
1. Use Async methods if possible
2. DELETE methods do not delete anything from database: you fill next attributes -> DeletedAt , DeletedBy - 'admin', DeletedReason - 'admin decision'
3. When you RETRIEVE something, check if an object was not deleted (deletedBy is empty for instance)
4. THINK OF REPLIES! EACH REPLY should inherit from CommonReply. Replies are dublicated in DTOs (api.models) and Domain (Watchman.Domain)



---------------Controllers
1. Must be partial (look at DictionariesController)

		DictionariesController -> contains only resolving of mediatr and mapper
			DictionariesController.Countries -> Works Only with countries
			DictionariesController.Genres -> Will Work Only with genres
			ETC.

----------------DI
1. All DI are taken place in next class -> Watchman.Infrastructure.ServiceCollectionExtensions -> AddInfrastructure() // you may find it in startup!
2. MappingProfiles are added in startup in AddApplication
